No arguments.  Example usage:
# freebsd-update-probe.sh || freebsd-update fetch [install]
# freebsd-update-probe.sh || mail_sysadmin_to_manually_update
Notes:
* When /usr/sbin/freebsd-update is run you *must* ensure it completes
  successfully (exit 0) as freebsd-update-probe.sh relies on it.
* Tested on FreeBSD 13.1, 13.0 (12.2 reported working)
* Not for FreeBSD Jail environments
* Not for non-RELEASE FreeBSD versions
* Not for detecting new RELEASE versions
