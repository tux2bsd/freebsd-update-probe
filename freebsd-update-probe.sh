freebsd-update-probe.sh takes no arguments.
Purpose:
* Efficiently determine update availability.
Usage, initially test for any "Notice" messages: 
# freebsd-update-probe.sh 
Usage, after the initial run (normal usage):
# freebsd-update-probe.sh || freebsd-update fetch [install]
# freebsd-update-probe.sh || mail_sysadmin_to_manually_update
Notes:
* When /usr/sbin/freebsd-update is run you *must* ensure it completes
  successfully (exit 0) as freebsd-update-probe.sh relies on it.
* Not for detecting new RELEASE versions
* Not for non-RELEASE FreeBSD versions
* Not for FreeBSD Jail environments
* Tested on FreeBSD 13.1, 13.0 (12.3, 12.2 reported working)
Version: 20220711 ### https://github.com/tux2bsd/freebsd-update-probe
