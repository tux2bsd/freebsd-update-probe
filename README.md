# freebsd-update-probe.sh

### Foreword
```
The community surrounding the FreeBSD project is hostile, in their own
weak way (banned from the forums for not kowtowing to their clique).
Technically, glaring subpar performance aspects are left in place (as
illustrated below).

I do not recommend FreeBSD and rate it as a "Hobby OS".
(March 2023, maybe one day I can change my mind)
```

## Efficiently detect updates for /usr/sbin/freebsd-update

### Summary
```
freebsd-update-probe.sh efficiently assesses the necessity of subsequently
running: /usr/sbin/freebsd-update fetch [install] 

The IO intensive phase of /usr/sbin/freebsd-update should be reserved
for when updates are available and freebsd-update-probe.sh was created
to achieve this.

This is not only a reduction in time, freebsd-update-probe.sh bypasses
the processing and IO spike that would otherwise occur for that duration
within `/usr/sbin/freebsd-update fetch [install]` , when no updates are
available it only makes sense to avoid this.

freebsd-update-probe.sh provides a work around for FreeBSD bug:
  https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=258863

freebsd-update-probe.sh was originally pushed to GitHub March 24 2022,
there have been a few minor improvements since.

Finally, I hope you find freebsd-update-probe.sh useful.
```

# Usage
```
Purpose:
* Efficiently determine update availability.
Usage:
# freebsd-update-probe.sh || freebsd-update fetch [install]
# freebsd-update-probe.sh || mail_sysadmin_to_manually_update
Notes:
* freebsd-update-probe.sh takes no arguments.
* If you see "Notice" messages, attend to those.
* When /usr/sbin/freebsd-update is run you *must* ensure it completes
  successfully (exit 0) as freebsd-update-probe.sh relies on it.
* Not for detecting new RELEASE versions
* Not for non-RELEASE FreeBSD versions
* Not for FreeBSD Jail environments
* Tested on FreeBSD 13.1, 13.0 (12.3, 12.2 reported working)

# Additional reading & Demonstrations
```
Confirmation of a lack of updates is reached hundreds of time faster on
Raspberry Pi 3B using freebsd-update-probe.sh, this is demonstrated below
(before/after).  IO bound hardware benefits greatly, results are far less
dramatic for fast IO but the reduction of unnecessary activity is gained.

freebsd-update-probe.sh tests for a match between the current "tag" and
the upstream "tag", /usr/sbin/freebsd-update generates the "tag" that is
stored on disk and the "tag" from /usr/sbin/freebsd-update is authoritive.
This "tag" file is probed by freebsd-update-probe.sh, hence the name.

Strictly speaking the updates mention above are point level updates.
freebsd-update-probe.sh has no knowledge of a new RELEASE, which is also
true for `/usr/sbin/freebsd-update fetch [install]`,  When a new RELEASE
version is available it must be manually installed, updating to a new
RELEASE is a distinct and deliberate action.
